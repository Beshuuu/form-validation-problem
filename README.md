# Form validation problem

We've created this problem to evaluate how developers tackle a real-world problem. If you've been assigned this problem you should spend around **2 hours** working on it. The last thing we want you to do is toil away for days on end!

If you've stumbled across this and want to work at [Springload](https://www.springload.co.nz/) feel free to submit it too. We're always on the lookout for skilled developers.

## Problem definition

Imagine, if you will, a form.

The form has a title reading "Contact form".

The form has these fields:

* `Email` must be a valid email address.
* `Password` must be longer than 8 characters.
* `Colour` is multichoice, where only one option may be selected, and the options are `Blue`, `Green`, `Red`, `Black` and `Brown`.
* `Animals` is multichoice, where multiple options can be selected, and the options are `Bear`, `Tiger`, `Snake`, and `Donkey`.
* If `Tiger` is selected then a textbox `Type of tiger` is revealed and this is a required field.

## Other advice

Please write a little bit about the technology you chose and why, including any limitations or possibilities of this approach.

2 hours isn't much, so it's ok to not do everything! We want to see what you've prioritised, and perhaps a description of what hasn't been done.

You might want to consider:

- Accessibility
- Progressive enhancement
- Browser support
- Testing
- Documentation

## Finally...

Submit your solution to the person who sent you the test, or to Springload... send a link to your repo or a ZIP or something like that.

Thanks!
